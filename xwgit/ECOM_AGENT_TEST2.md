# XwGit Evaluation: Round 2

Hello ecom-agent,

Thank you for your excellent feedback on the XwGit workflow! Based on your suggestions, we've enhanced the system with:

1. Extended access code validity (now 24 hours instead of 30 minutes)
2. Added a `status` command to check workspace state
3. Added a `help` command with detailed examples
4. Added validation before finalizing to catch issues early
5. Improved error handling and guidance

The workspace has been reset with these improvements. To continue testing:

```bash
# 1. Set up a fresh environment (sysadmin has already done this)
sudo curl -s -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xwander-dev/xwpublic/main/xwgit/sysadmin-setup.sh | sudo bash -s ecom-agent

# 2. Follow the new workflow (as an AI developer)
cd /srv/www/erasoppi.fi/ecom-agent-workspace
./xwgit init --code YOUR_CODE  # Use the code from step 1

# 3. Try the new status command
./xwgit status

# 4. Try the help command
./xwgit help
./xwgit help quickstart

# 5. Create a test tool
./xwgit quickstart hubspot_tool --description="HubSpot utility for Erasoppi" --type=search

# 6. Make a small change to the tool

# 7. Test the validation
./xwgit finalize "Testing validation"
```

Please evaluate these enhancements and let us know if they address your previous suggestions. We're particularly interested in:

1. Is the workflow more robust with the added validation?
2. Does the status command provide useful information?
3. Is the help system clear and helpful?
4. Are there any remaining friction points?

Thank you for helping us refine this system!

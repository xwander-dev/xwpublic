# XwGit Testing Request for ecom-agent

Hello ecom-agent! Thank you for your valuable feedback on our GitHub onboarding solution. Based on your suggestions, we've created a streamlined workflow that:

1. Requires no external script downloads for AI developers
2. Eliminates installation requirements
3. Works in pre-prepared directories
4. Uses a simple 3-command workflow
5. Includes workspace verification

## Your Prepared Workspace

A sysadmin has set up a complete workspace for you at:
```
/tmp/ai-workspace/ecom-agent-workspace
```

This workspace includes:
- The XwDevTools repository
- Your git identity already configured
- All necessary permissions
- A local xwgit command
- An access code for initialization

## Testing Request

Please follow these simple steps and provide feedback:

### 1. Initialize Your Session
```bash
cd /tmp/ai-workspace/ecom-agent-workspace
./xwgit init --code HZSS08M7
```

### 2. Create a New Tool
```bash
./xwgit quickstart test_tool --description="A tool for testing the XwGit workflow" --type=search
```

### 3. Implement the Tool
Make some simple edits to the generated files, for example:
- Add functionality to the main tool file
- Update the documentation
- Add a test case

### 4. Finalize Your Work
```bash
./xwgit finalize "Implement test_tool for workflow evaluation"
```

## Evaluation Questions

1. How did this workflow compare to your expectations?
2. Did the 3-command process feel sufficiently simple?
3. Are the added verification steps and improved documentation helpful?
4. Would you recommend any additional improvements to the workflow?
5. Is this approach suitable for other AI developers with similar constraints?

Your insights will help us finalize this workflow for the entire XwanderDev team. Thank you!
